			MINOR ISSUES


System.IO.FileNotFoundException: 'The configuration file 'AppSettings.json' was not found and is not optional. 
				The expected physical path was 'C:\Users\aaron\source\projectTypesRepos\HomeWork\SqlTypes\SqlServerHWApp\SqlServerHW\bin\Debug\net6.0										\AppSettings.json'.'

	FIX:	Had to change ConfigurationBuilder variable .SetBasePath to the location of the "AppSettings.json" file [@"C:\Users\aaron\source\projectTypesRepos
														\HomeWork\SqlType\SqlServerHWApp\SqlServerHW]
	FIX (alternate): I discovered that the property "Copy to Output Directory"
		 in the json File properties places the file in the Current working directory





System.ArgumentException: 'Keyword not supported: 'trust server certificate'.'
			
	TRIED:	tried getting rid of spaces between words and changing value to True (didn't work)
	FIX:	found and deleted a duplicate configuation .json file in '\bin\Debug\net6.0'
